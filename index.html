    <div class="tab-content" id="content1"> Looking for the qualities in others that make us different is essential to uniting us all together. The world today has become divided and judgemental. We often forget how easy it is to judge, but also how harmful that can be. People are unique and special in their own ways and it’s those differences that can bring us together. <br><br> Not everyone keeps this in mind throughout daily life, though. We start to get into our own heads and reflect our judgements about ourselves onto those around us, but somehow, those judgements often fly past our close inner circles. The people we love more than ourselves. Which is why, to practice this more welcoming mindset, we need to start with those close relationships and form deeper connections with them. Seeing them in a new light can make all the difference. <br><br> This project is about seeing those you love in a different light. These photos depict a physical difference of my own family members, but the real characteristics we learn about them are much deeper than physical appearances. The abstraction in the images is symbolic of those traits we can’t see, by seeing an ordinary person in an unordinary way. In each caption, they are answering a question: what is something people assume about you that isn’t true? I hope to inspire change in the world and the best way to do that is to start small. My goal is to inspire others to have more compassion for others and that starts within our own circles. Start small, change big.
