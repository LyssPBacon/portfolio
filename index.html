                    It's easy to forget that the things that make us all different are important. Our differences are what make us unique and every person special. It's important to recognize and embrace these differences, and in some cases, look for them. Looking for these qualities in others is essential to uniting us all together.
                    <br><br>
                    I know how hard it can be to remember this, it's not something everyone keeps in mind at all times. People can be harsh and judgemental, but I think a culture of understanding is something everyone should strive for. The best way to practice this to become a normal part of life, though, is to start where you are. The people around you, your friends and family, are just as important to understand as anyone else. Diving deep into our closest relationships and really learning who they are is an eye-opening way for us to grow a deeper connection with those we love. Seeing them in a different light can make all the difference.

                    This project is about seeing those you love in a different light. These photos depict a physical difference of my own family members, but the real characteristics we learn about them are much deeper than physical appearances. I hope to inspire change in the world and the best way to do that is to start small. My goal is to inspire others to have more compassion for others and that starts within our own circles. Start small, change big.
